Steps I took:

1. Download Stone Soup source (at time 0.10.2)
2. Create file "Android.mk" with basic template (eg from hello-jni)
3. Added LOCAL_CPP_EXTENSION=.cc
4. Added all ".cc" files in source to LOCAL_SRC_FILES
5. Added "Application.mk" with APP_STL=gnustl_shared
6. Added to Android.mk LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/rltiles
7. Ran source/util/art-data.pl to generate art-data.h and dc-unrand.txt (and tiledef-unrand.cc?)
8. Added instructions to Android.mk to build sqlite as a static library, added sqlite folder to LOCAL_SRC_FILES,
added LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES:=libsqlite3
9. LUA included from contrib folder:
 a. Added build instruction for lua in Android.mk. 
 b. Added lua folder to LOCAL_SRC_FILES
 c. Added LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES=liblua
10. Added LOCAL_CFLAGS += -frtti since otherwise 'dynamic_cast' can't be called in spl-miscast.h
11. (maybe move after running art-data.pl): ran 'make' in source/rltiles to generate
.cc and .h files. Added these to the source files and LOCAL_C_INCLUDES respectively.
12. Added "-fexceptions" to LOCAL_CFLAGS to enable exceptions (arena.cc had issues)
13. modified crash.cc to not define BACKTRACE_SUPPORTED when Android defined (might change
this to use log.h in this case)
14. Removed libunix.cc, added a highly modified and stubbed version libandroid.cc
15. Ran ./util/gen-mst.pl to generate mon-mst.h
NOTE: seems like all the .pl files in /util need to be run. Might get a shell script happening for this
16. Added ANDROID to list of OSes in syscalls.h:24 to define our fake fdatasync (crash in package.cc:219/226)
17. Removed tilecell.cc. We're not building with tiles right now (crawl before you walk. HA)
18. Actually removed a whole bunch of tile related files, commented in Android.mk
19. ran 'source/util/gen_ver.pl build.h' to generate version header build.h
20. ran 'util/gen-cflg.pl compflag.h none armeabi android android' to generate compflag.h
21. Editted llex.c (around line 181) to allow compiling for android (see http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=943)
22. Added zlib by adding LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz
23. Editted sqlite3.c as per http://www.androiddiscuss.com/1-android-discuss/23750.html (line 25125)
24. Added prebuilt/levcomp.lex.cc and prebuilt/levcomp.tab.cc and header files in that dir to Android.mk
ZOMG COMPILES

So ideally, to build from the checked out code, one would:
1. Run source/util/art-data.pl
2. Run source/util/gen-mst.pl
3. Run 'make' in source/rltiles
4. Run 'source/util/gen_ver.pl build.h'
5. Run 'util/gen-cflg.pl compflag.h none armeabi android android'
6. Then run $NDK/ndk-build (assuming you have the NDK. We're using r8 atm.
