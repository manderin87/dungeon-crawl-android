<p>If you have problems using this program, please go to 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dungeon-crawl-android/">http://code.google.com/p/dungeon-crawl-android/</a> or 
<a href="mailto:michaelbarlow7@gmail.com">send me an email</a></p>

<p>You *could* leave feedback on Google Play, but the above is a bit more direct.</p>

<p>Press '?' in the game for instructions.</p>

<br>
<p><b>The Game Screen:</b></p>
<p>The screen is divided into a three by three grid for touch
input. Tapping in any of these grid areas sends the corresponding directional key
to the program.  
</p>

<p><b>Configuration:</b></p>
<p>Press Menu-> Preferences to access options. You can change certain display
and input settings via this screen. You can also edit configuration files.
The main configuration file for Dungeon Crawl is init.txt. The comments
explain what options you can set. You can also find more details in the 
in-game help (press '?', then press '&amp;')
</p>

<br>
<p><b>Virtual Keyboard:</b></p>
The virtual keyboard can be enabled through preferences.
It has a numeric mode which has the number keys arranged for directional input.
The virtual keyboard also has a Control mode "^X" which sends Control keys.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Trackball/D-Pad:</b></p>
<p>By default, moving the trackball sends cursor keys to program (up, down, left,
right). Pressing the trackball once indicates that the next key should be
a Control key.  Pressing the trackball twice in a row
sends an "enter" key.  Control keys can also be entered by holding down the 
trackball followed by a letter.  
Control followed by a direction (or screen directional tap) will 
peform various in-game functions such as digging.
</p>

<br>
<p><b>Hardware Keyboard and Other Keys:</b></p>
<p>The Escape key can be entered by pressing the Back button.</p>

<p>Detailed hardware key mapping can be changed in preferences. When assigning 
hardware keys, the interface will ask you to press a hardware key.  If the key
you press was already assigned to another function, be aware that the original
function will now be unassigned. </p>

<p>If you configure your menu button for a function other than showing the menu, 
you will need to use a long screen press to access Preferences and other menu choices.
Hardware key mapping can be reset to the default configuration in preferences.</p>

<p>Pressing the home button on the phone will cause the program to go
into the background. </p>
